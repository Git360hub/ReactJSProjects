<!--
What are the primitive types in JS ? give example of each.
        Whole Number myfavouritenumber = 7 #This variable represents my favourite number. 
        Float myfavoritenumber = 1.234 #(Float)
        String myname = "My name is Desseray Stepski" #(String)
        Boolean This_is_homework = True # Represents if this is homework or not #(Boolean)
        BigInt mybigint = 12345678901234567890n # Represents a large integer #(BigInt)
        Undefined myvariable # Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value #(Undefined)
        Null mynull = None # Represents the intentional absence of any object value #(Null)
        Symbol mysymbol = Symbol("description") # Represents a unique and immutable value #(Symbol)


        When should you use an object ?
        You should use an object when you want to store multiple related values as key-value pairs. 
        Objects are ideal for representing complex entities with various attributes. 
        For example, a car object might have properties like make, model, year, and color.

        When should you use an array ?
        You should use an array when you want to store a list of items or a collection of values. 
        Arrays are ideal for representing ordered data and can hold multiple values of the same type. 
        For example, an array of colors might look like this: ["red", "green", "blue"].
